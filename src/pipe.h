/// \defgroup fiber-module Fibers
///
/// \brief Fibers of execution
///
/// Seastar continuations are normally short, but often chained to one
/// another, so that one continuation does a bit of work and then schedules
/// another continuation for later. Such chains can be long, and often even
/// involve loopings - see for example \ref repeat. We call such chains
/// "fibers" of execution.
///
/// These fibers are not threads - each is just a string of continuations -
/// but they share some common requirements with traditional threads.
/// For example, we want to avoid one fiber getting starved while a second
/// fiber continuously runs its continuations one after another.
/// As another example, fibers may want to communicate - e.g., one fiber
/// produces data that a second fiber consumes, and we wish to ensure that
/// both fibers get a chance to run, and that if one stops prematurely,
/// the other doesn't hang forever.
///
/// Consult the following table to see which APIs are useful for fiber tasks:
///
/// Task                                           | APIs
/// -----------------------------------------------|-------------------
/// Repeat a blocking task indefinitely            | \ref keep_doing()
/// Repeat a blocking task, then exit              | \ref repeat(), \ref do_until()
/// Provide mutual exclusion between two tasks     | \ref semaphore, \ref shared_mutex
/// Pass a stream of data between two fibers       | \ref seastar::pipe
/// Safely shut down a resource                    | \ref seastar::gate, \ref seastar::with_gate()
/// Hold on to an object while a fiber is running  | \ref do_with()

/// \brief A fixed-size pipe for communicating between two fibers.
///
/// A pipe<T> is a mechanism to transfer data between two fibers, one
/// producing data, and the other consuming it. The fixed-size buffer also
/// ensures a balanced execution of the two fibers, because the producer
/// fiber blocks when it writes to a full pipe, until the consumer fiber gets
/// to run and read from the pipe.
///
/// A pipe<T> resembles a Unix pipe, in that it has a read side, a write side,
/// and a fixed-sized buffer between them, and supports either end to be closed
/// independently (and EOF or broken pipe when using the other side).
/// A pipe<T> object holds the reader and write sides of the pipe as two
/// separate objects. These objects can be moved into two different fibers.
/// Importantly, if one of the pipe ends is destroyed (i.e., the continuations
/// capturing it end), the other end of the pipe will stop blocking, so the
/// other fiber will not hang.
///
/// The pipe's read and write interfaces are future-based blocking. I.e., the
/// write() and read() methods return a future which is fulfilled when the
/// operation is complete. The pipe is single-reader single-writer, meaning
/// that until the future returned by read() is fulfilled, read() must not be
/// called again (and same for write).
///
/// Note: The pipe reader and writer are movable, but *not* copyable. It is
/// often convenient to wrap each end in a shared pointer, so it can be
/// copied (e.g., used in an std::function which needs to be copyable) or
/// easily captured into multiple continuations.
