/// or take them away.  Taking units from the counter may wait
/// if not enough units are available.
///
/// To support exceptional conditions, a \ref broken() method
/// is provided, which causes all current waiters to stop waiting,

/// fibers that are blocked on a semaphore to continue.  This is
/// similar to POSIX's `pthread_cancel()`, with \ref wait() acting
/// as a cancellation point.
///
/// \tparam ExceptionFactory template parameter allows modifying a semaphore to throw
/// customized exceptions on timeout/broken(). It has to provide two static functions
/// ExceptionFactory::timeout() and ExceptionFactory::broken() which return corresponding
/// exception object.
